    <h1>My Personal Website</h1>
<p> 
    Hello! My name is <em>Surafele</em> I'm from Port Coquitlam, graduated in 2020 from Terry Fox Secondary. 
    I enjoy <strong>working out, hanging out with friends, watching movies.</strong> 
    I have little background with computers and database, 
    I am somewhat tech savvy I'd say, always had an interest with computers. 
    The reason I chose CIT is because I feel like it aligns closely with my interests!
    I am currently taking seven classes while enrolled in this is program, three of the courses
    I am taking are;
<ul>
<li>Fundamental Web Technologies</li>
<li>System Administration</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20223048468/">Database Systems</a></li>

</ul>
